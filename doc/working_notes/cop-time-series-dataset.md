# High Level Overview

Each `Time Series Dataset` is an instantiation of a `Time Series Definition`.

Each `Time Series Definition` specifies:
  * the variable captured by the time series
  * the resolution of the variable measurement
  * the periodicity of the time series
  * the level of data processing applied
  * the method by which the time series is captured or derived
    * for all time series definitions, some documentation of the methodology as direct text and/or as links to documentation 
    * for definitions of derived time series, links to the time series definitions for the input time series
    * for 

Each `Variable` (I'm proposing we rename `Complex Observable Property` to make the alignment the Variable concept clearer) will specify:

  * The abstract property being measured (e.g. temperature)
  * The object of interest (e.g. air)
  * The context within which the observation is made
  * The constraints placed on the observation (e.g. 2m above ground level)
  * The unit of measurement

The following **variables** are distinct under this scheme:
  * soil temperature at 2cm below ground level
  * soil temperature at 20cm below ground level
  * incoming longwave radiation (corrected)
  * incoming longwave radiation (uncorrected)
  * outgoing longwave radiation
  * volume of precipitation captured by a rainguage
  * volume of precipitation captured by a tipping bucket

**NOTE**: The last two are proposed to be distinct based on the fact that the COSMOS TIMESERIES.csv file lists different PARAMETER_ID values for time-series originating from a tipping bucket from those originating from a rain guage. I'd look to a domain expert to provide guidance on whether these are truly distinct variables.

The following time series may be defined which all share the same variable:

  * incoming long-wave radiation (corrected), raw, mean, 30m
  * incoming long-wave radiation (corrected), raw, std dev, 30m
  * incoming long-wave radiation (corrected), level 2, total, 1 day
  * incoming long-wave radiation (corrected), level 3, mean, 30m

**NOTES**:

The `uses` relationship could be specified indirectly via a `TimeSeriesPlan` but this requires a separate `TimeSeriesPlan` for each derived or aggregated time series. An alternative would be to say that the `derivedFrom` relationship relates a `TimeSeriesDefinition` to the `TimeSeriesDefinition`s that are used as input into deriving it and that the `methodology` relation relates a `TimeSeriesDefinition` to a `Plan` that describes how the derivation is performed without specifying which specific time series are used as inputs, allowing all time series that share the same derivation methodology to refer to the same `Plan`.

The `type` relation between `TimeSeriesDataset` and `TimeSeriesDefinition` could be a more specific `hasDefinition` relationship if preferred.

The relationship between a derived time series definition and the input time series definitions could be a more direct property rather than going via a `Plan` if preferred. This would then maybe require any description or documentation of the methodology to also migrate from `Plan` to `TimeSeriesDefinition`.
