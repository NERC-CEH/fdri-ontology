# CHANGELOG

Ticket numbers referenced in the CHANGELOG refer to issues in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/NERC-CEH/fdri-ontology/issues

DRAFT 0.4.2
-----------

* FIX: Fixed the property URI of RelatedPartyAttribution.agent in the recordspec schema to match the OWL schema.
* FIX: Fixed the class URI of RelatedPartyRole to match the OWL ontology.

DRAFT 0.4.1
-----------

* NEW: Added new property `fdri:valueType` which can be used on a `schema:PropertyValue` to convey the datatype or class of the value of the property. (#23)
* NEW: Allow property `fdri:valueType` to appear on `fdri:Measure` to convey the expected datatype for observed value of the measure. (#19)
* NEW: Allow property `prov:qualifiedAttribution` with range only `fdri:RelatedPartyAttribution` on `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringFacilityType`. This allows the capture of parties related to a category of facilities (e.g. the manufacturer of a type of sensor). (#4)
* NEW: Allow property `skos:altLabel` on `skos:Concept` records in the recordspec schema. (#7)
* NEW: Added new property `fdri:measures` with range `fdri:Measure`. Property is used on `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringFacility` to capture the measures that the facility has the capablity to make, or on `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringFacilityType` to capture the measures that facilities of that type have the capablity to make. (#5)
* NEW: Allow property `dct:identifier` on the `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringFacility` and `fdri:FacilityGroup` in the recordspec schema. (#18)
* NEW: Added new property `fdri:calibrationDue` as an optional property of `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringSystem`. (#17)
* NEW: Added property `dcat:keyword` as an optional, repeatable propety of `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringSystemType`. (#8)
* NEW: Added properties `fdri:deploymentNote` and `fdri:dependencyNote`. Made `fdri:deploymentVariance` and `fdri:dependencyNote` sub-properties of `fdri:deploymentNote`. The domain of `fdri:deploymentNote` is restricted to `fdri:Deployment`. (#16)
* NEW: Added property `fdri:canopyHeight` as an optional property of `fdri:Deployment`. (#15)
* NEW: Added property `ssn:implements` as an optional repeatable property of `fdri:Deployment` to capture procedures are implemented by the deployment such as sampling regimes. (#10)
* CHANGE: Made `hasProcedure` on `EnvironmentalMonitoringSystemType` repeatable in the recordspec schema to match the OWL definition.
* NEW: Added property `fdri:settleInPeriod` as an optional property of both `fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringSystemType` and `fdri:Deployment` to capture the settle-in time that should elapse from the deployment start before readinds are considered to be accurate. (#9)
* NEW: Added support for relating an `fdri:Procedure` to the document(s) for that procedure (#26):
  * Add schema:DigitalDocument and schema:MediaObject classes to represent a document and a document download respectively, and add fdri:document property that has schema:DigitalDocument as its range.
* CHANGE: Made fdri:certification a sub-property of fdri:document, this allows the certification document location and format to be specified.
* UPDATE: Updated documentation to describe how sensor error codes can be modelled as an `fdri:SystemCapabaility` (#11)

DRAFT 0.4
---------

* NEW: Added documentation strings to OWL model
* BREAKING: Removed unused types Catchment, Region and MobileDeployment from OWL model. Catchment and Region are replaced by fdri:FacilityGroup.
* NEW: Add fdri:FacilityGroup to be used to capture arbitrary groupings of facilities into e.g. catchments, geographical regions, administrative areas etc.
* NON-BREAKING: Removed sub-class relationship between fdri:SoftwareAgent and prov:SoftwareAgent
* NEW: Add fdri:Measure, fdri:MeasureScheme
* NEW: Add fdri:Unit and fdri:UnitScheme to be used for measures in preference to qudt:Unit
* NEW: Add S3 source properties to fdri:TimeSeriesDataset
* NON-BREAKING: Declare a subclass relationship between skos:Concept and the iAdopt classes iop:Entity, iop:Property and iop:Variable to support managing these terms as controlled vocabularies.
* BREAKING: Remove fdri:Site properties fdri:soilType and fdri:landCover. These are now encoded as annotations
* BREAKING: Remove fdri:hadFault property. Use the inverse fdri:affectsFacility instead.
* NEW: Add provenance properties to fdri:EnvironmentalMonitoringFacility
* NEW: Allow fdri:appliesToTimeSeries property to appear on DataProcessingConfiguration.
* BREAKING: Update recordspec schema to only support fdri:appliesToTimeSeries and not allow fdri:appliesToVariable on a DataProcessingConfiguration (though this is stil supported by the OWL model)
* BREAKING: Remove fdri:DataProcessingActivity and replace with soft-typing via dct:type on Activity. Added ActivityType and ActivityTypeScheme to manage controlled vocabularies of activity type.
